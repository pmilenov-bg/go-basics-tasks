# aim: to practice the basics go tasks

Interacting
    working with numbers:
    from a given input(in this case slice....) we produse slices
        one eliminate the repeated number within the slice
        the other show the only repeated ones

    working with maps:
    taking two maps with keys and integer values as input and returns the combined key-value pairs from both input maps.

working with struct
    defining Struct "Rectangle" with field and "Circle"
        width and height and consequently radius (float64)
    creating Methods "Area" and "Perimeter" that calculate velues due to the input values


interfaces
    defining "Shape" interface whith the following methods
        Area and Perimeter implementing the two methods


# Testing

creating few test for each of the functions
